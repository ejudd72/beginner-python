# Installing python:

- python.org/downloads

- 2 major versions, 2 is legacy and not actively maintained - install 3

- Choose an IDE for python - Jetbrains Pycharm

## Print
- print("")

## Variables
- no need to declare or declare type - e.g. character_name = "John"
- Separate words with underscore

- only strings can concatenate to strings, numbers cant, you must convert numbers to strings

### Strings
- see programme for full examples

### numbers
- integers, decimals, negatives, all handled well with python
- can do arithmetic e.g. +, -, /, *, % inside python
- can do parenthesis to suggest order of operation

### User inputs = 
- Get an input by using input("my prompt here") - if you store this to a variable, it will old whatever the user inputs after that prompt
- Python by default will make user input a string
- If you add them they will concatenate instead of behaving like numbers
- to convert to numbers, use int(input) for integers, or float(input) for decimals
